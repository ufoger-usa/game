Here are some ideas to make your UFO abduction game more interesting:

1. **Power-ups:** Add items that occasionally appear (e.g., speed boost, time extension, shield) for the player to collect.
2. **Levels or Waves:** Increase difficulty over time by adding more obstacles, faster drones, or more burgers to abduct.
3. **Enemy Drones:** Add drones that chase or shoot at the UFO, requiring the player to dodge or use a shield.
4. **Combo/Multiplier System:** Reward players for abducting multiple burgers in quick succession with score multipliers.
5. **Achievements:** Add unlockable achievements for high scores, streaks, or special actions.
6. **Visual Effects:** Add particle effects, explosions, or animated backgrounds for more visual appeal.
7. **Soundtrack and SFX:** Add background music and more sound effects for actions like abduction, power-ups, or collisions.
8. **Story/Progression:** Add a simple story or progression map, with new locations or UFO skins unlocked as you play.
9. **Leaderboards:** Show a global or local leaderboard for high scores.
10. **Touch/Mobile Controls:** Add swipe or tilt controls for mobile play.
